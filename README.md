# Machine Learning Learning Path 🌱

Welcome to my Machine Learning journey!  
This repository is a collection of code, exercises, and small projects that I’ve completed as I learn machine learning step by step. It is continuously updated as I progress through new topics and courses.

## 📌 About This Repository

This is a **learning-in-public** project. I use this repo to:

- Practice machine learning concepts through code
- Organize my notebooks and notes
- Share examples from online courses and tutorials
- Track my learning progress over time

## 🧠 Topics Covered (So Far)

As of now, I’ve explored the following topics:

- ✅ **Simple Linear Regression**
- ✅ **Multiple Linear Regression**
- ✅ **Polynomial (Non-linear) Regression**
- ✅ **Other Non-linear Regression Models**

Upcoming topics include:

- ⏳ Classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees)
- ⏳ Unsupervised Learning (Clustering, PCA)
- ⏳ Model Evaluation & Selection
- ⏳ Feature Engineering & Data Preprocessing
- ⏳ Real-world ML Projects

> This repository will grow as I continue learning. Stay tuned!
